## Logging Configuration

The application uses Python's built-in `logging` module for configurable logging. You can control the logging level using environment variables.

### Logging Levels

- `DEBUG`: Most verbose, shows all log messages
- `INFO`: Shows general information
- `WARNING`: Shows only warnings and errors
- `ERROR`: Shows only error messages
- `CRITICAL`: Shows only critical error messages

### Setting Log Level

You can set the log level using the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable:

```bash
# Set log level to DEBUG
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Run the application
python app.py
```

### Log Outputs

Logs are output to:
- Console (standard output)
- `app.log` file in the project directory
